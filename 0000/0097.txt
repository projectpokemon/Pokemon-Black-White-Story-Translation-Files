Up ahead is Route 16, which leads\xfffeto the Wonder Bridge!
Somebody has a camper out in the\xfffe Lost Forest off of Route 16.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI wonder where they’re from…
That Pokémon…\xfffeZoroark...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeIt fools everyone by staying hidden...
I train the body vigorously!\xf000븁\x0000You look like you train hard...\xfffeBUT NOT HARD ENOUGH!!!\xf000븁\x0000Give this to your Pokémon\xfffeand push them to the limit!!!\xf000븁\x0000
Your Pokémon won’t be able to move\xfffeas fast while wearing the Macho Brace.\xf000븀\x0000But...they will grow much more quickly!\xf000븁\x0000It’s not the easiest brace to use,\xfffebut you won't regret it later!
