You're an amazing\xfffePokémon trainer!\xf000븁\x0000Me and my Pokémon are both happy\xfffeto have had our first real challenge\xf000븀\x0000in a long time.\xf000븁\x0000I'm happy to present you this official\xfffeLeague-approved gym badge! It suits you!\xf000븁\x0000

If you use that attack, Acrobat,\xfffeand the Pokémon isn't holding any items,\xf000븀\x0000it'll double your power!\xf000븀\x0000It's kind of a strategic attack.\xf000븁\x0000...As in, you can use it to cover for your\xfffedemerit of not holding any items!\xf000븁\x0000...Right, so.\xfffeIf you cross Mt. Helix\xf000븀\x0000to Sekka City...\xf000븁\x0000Team Plasma, was it?\xfffeWell, they seem to be headed there...\xf000븀\x0000What kind of people are they, anyway?
Sekka City, where you'll find the next gym,\xfffeis past Route 7 and over Mt. Helix.\xf000븁\x0000It's a cinch with a plane,\xfffebut rough on foot.\xf000븀\x0000Make sure you're prepared!
Fuuro: Are you and\xfffeyour Pokémon doing well?\xf000븁\x0000I remember the Pokémon\xfffebattle I had with you...\xf000븁\x0000And you've continued to train\xfffeyour Pokémon ever since!\xf000븁\x0000My cargo plane\xfffecan't transport people,\xf000븁\x0000but I bet you can train anywhere!
Here, take this\xfffeFresh Water!\xf000븁\x0000
Just between the two of us...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeRock, electric, ice...\xfffeflying-types have quite a few weaknesses,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffesurprisingly!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeSo as ever, use Pokémon and\xfffeattacks of those types\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand victory is before you! And such.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBy the way, you'll have to get inside\xfffecannons to proceed in this gym.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can step into the cannons from\xfffeany side - top, bottom, right, or left!
