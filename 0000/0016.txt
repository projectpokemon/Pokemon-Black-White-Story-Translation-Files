Hey！\xfffeHave you heard of a Great Ball？\xf000븁\x0000It's a type of Pokeball that has a  higher\xfffechance of capturing a Pokemon！\xf000븁\x0000
Don't forget though that it can still fail\xf000븀\x0000\x0000 isn't ever a 100% chance！\xf000븁\x0000I believe the Pokemart may be getting\xfffethem because with Great Balls\xf000븀\x0000It is easy to catch Pokémon！
