Ryokushi: ...Once I catch the Pokémon\xfffeUlgamoth in this castle,\xf000븀\x0000I'll present it to Lord Geechisu.\xf000븁\x0000Or so I planned,\xfffebut isn't even the Dark Trinity saying\xf000븀\x0000that Lord Geechisu has hidden away\xf000븀\x0000in whereabouts unknown...?\xf000븁\x0000
The Seven Sages...\xf000븁\x0000And when all seven are gathered,\xfffethey are perfect...\xf000븁\x0000I don't know what those words\xfffereally mean anymore.\xf000븁\x0000I can understand their use, but\xfffeI can no longer see the dream...\xf000븁\x0000
I don't need this anymore.\xf000븁\x0000Lord Geechisu gave it to me,\xfffebut I have no intentions for it.\xf000븁\x0000
Ryokushi: Both this Ancient Castle\xfffeand our castle have crumbled...\xf000븁\x0000The only difference is that\xfffethe Ancient Castle is the remains\xf000븀\x0000of a civilization...\xf000븁\x0000Nothing of our castle\xfffewas left behind...\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Alright, then...\xfffeI'm an international policeman!\xf000븁\x0000So tell me what you know\xfffeabout Team Plasma!\xf000븁\x0000
Ryokushi: ...Understood.\xf000븁\x0000But we know little about\xfffeLord Geechisu and Lord N both.\xf000븁\x0000We don't even have a certainty that\xfffethey are truly parent and child...\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Besides Geechisu, I guess this leaves\xfffe\xf000Ȁ\x0001\x0000 of the Seven Sages remaining...\xf000븁\x0000I want to know what they were\xfffethinking and hoping for...\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again!\xf000븁\x0000
Looker: Thanks!\xf000븁\x0000Okay, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000...\xfffeThere's something I need to tell you.\xf000븁\x0000I've heard intel that, somewhere\xfffereally far away from here,\xf000븀\x0000there's been sighting of an N-ish person\xf000븀\x0000with a dragon Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000I'm going to go and see\xfffeif it's really true!\xf000븀\x0000Well, see you again someday!\xf000븁\x0000
