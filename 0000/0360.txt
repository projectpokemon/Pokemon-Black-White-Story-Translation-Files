That sandstorm is pretty rough!\xf000븁\x0000I could really use a Ground or Steel\xfffetype Pokémon right now.xf000븀\x0000They wouldn't get hurt by the storm.
They aren't too proud of this\xfffebut they're good diggers!\xf000븁\x0000Here, you can have this\xfffeTM for Dig!\xf000븁\x0000
If you use Dig in a cave,\xfffeyou'll return right to the entrance!\xf000븁\x0000Amazing, isn't it!?\xfffeI use it whenever I'm stuck!
