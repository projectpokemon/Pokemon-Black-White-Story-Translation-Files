If we are to do away\xfffewith mistaken values...
We'll steal Pokémon from people!\xfffeThey'll play together no longer!
Trainers releasing their Pokémon\xfffewill put an end to trainers!
We are in the right!
Everyone except us is WRONG!
If you're not part of our solution,\xfffeit's QUITE LIKELY you're just a problem!
Arti: Hm...\xf000븁\x0000There are only two ways\xfffeout of Yaguruma Forest.\xf000븁\x0000There's the path straight through,\xfffeand the path through the forest.\xf000븁\x0000
If we head down both,\xfffewe should catch up to them.\xf000븁\x0000
Even if they're not there,\xfffewe'll make sure to shut up the exits\xf000븀\x0000so they can't escape.\xf000븁\x0000
Would you search this route to see\xfffeif there are any Plasma grunts hiding?\xf000븁\x0000There are lots of trainers too, but\xfffeit's a straight path in essence,\xf000븀\x0000so you won't get lost.\xf000븁\x0000
Well, then! Shall we do this,\xfffefor Miss Aloe?\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: ...Mhm?\xf000븁\x0000It doesn't seem...\xfffethat Team Plasma's come this way.\xf000븁\x0000The bugs of the forest are quiet...
Arti: ...Mhm?\xf000븁\x0000It doesn't seem...\xfffethat Team Plasma's come this way.\xf000븁\x0000The bugs of the forest are quiet...\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Stubborn brat!\xf000븁\x0000I'll show you what's what right here\xfffeif it'll keep you off our backs!!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Too bad!\xfffeI don't have a thing.\xf000븁\x0000If you want it back bad,\xfffebetter go find the rest of us!
Grunt: Oh?\xfffeLooking for something, are we?\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Apologies!\xfffeYou've caught me empty-handed.\xf000븁\x0000A girl like me wouldn't be\xfffelugging around such a heavy object.\xf000븀\x0000Surely it must be elsewhere!
Grunt: You're this far, eh?!\xf000븁\x0000I'll keep you busy so the rest\xfffeof the grunts can escape!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: That's right!\xfffeI was just here to stall you!\xf000븁\x0000Heh! Better hurry up,\xfffeor those grunts'll get away!
Grunt: Oh, what's this?\xf000븁\x0000My allies couldn't have been\xfffedefeated by this twerp, could they?!\xf000븁\x0000Well, whatever!\xfffeI'm your opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: ...Alright, fine.\xfffeHave your stupid skull back!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Could this mean that our hopes...\xfffeand our king's hopes...\xf000븀\x0000are all in vain...?\xf000븁\x0000
Ashura: Are you alright?\xf000븁\x0000You swore your loyalty\xfffeto the king!\xf000븁\x0000
Grunt: Sage!\xf000븁\x0000I got the skull this far, but then\xfffeit was stolen right before my eyes!\xf000븁\x0000
Asura: It's fine.\xf000븁\x0000We'll just give up on\xfffethe Dragon Skull for now.\xf000븁\x0000After all, it had nothing to do with\xfffethe legendary Pokémon that Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000has been searching for.\xf000븁\x0000
But we will not\xfffeoverlook your meddling.\xf000븁\x0000Don't get in our way again,\xfffeor we'll make you pay.\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: Ah, great!\xf000븁\x0000From the bustling of the bug Pokémon,\xfffeI could tell a bigshot was around.\xf000븁\x0000Did you come to aid\xfffethe guys we just beat?\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xfffeArti!\xf000븁\x0000The others didn't have jack...\xf000븁\x0000So, what, is this guy their boss?\xf000븁\x0000
Ashura: I am one of Team Plasma's\xfffeSeven Sages.\xf000븁\x0000Geechisu, also one of the sages, is using\xfffehis eloquence to convince people\xf000븀\x0000to release their Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000The rest of us Sages order\xfffethe members of Team Plasma\xf000븀\x0000to steal Pokémon!\xf000븁\x0000But this is only a minor\xfffeand necessary evil.\xf000븁\x0000The bug-user Arti,\xfffeand the normal-user Aloe...\xf000븁\x0000I know that you two\xfffewould fight a hundred battles...\xf000븀\x0000We will obediently pull back for now.\xf000븁\x0000
But we shall take Pokémon from\xfffetrainers to liberate them!\xf000븁\x0000Not even from gym leaders\xfffeshall we allow any meddling!\xf000븁\x0000When might this matter be resolved?\xfffeRegardless, I look forward to it...\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: They're quick runners, eh?\xf000븁\x0000Well, Arti,\xfffeyou gonna give chase?\xf000븁\x0000
Arti: No...\xf000븁\x0000We cornered them and\xfffetook back your stolen skull.\xf000븀\x0000I don't know what else they're guilty of.\xf000븁\x0000Well, Miss Aloe,\xfffeI've got to be going...\xf000븁\x0000
And also... I'll be waiting for YOU to\xfffechallenge me at the Hiun City Pokémon Gym!\xf000븁\x0000Yep, yep!\xfffeOoh, really looking forward to that...\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000That's the Dragon Skull you\xfffetoiled to get back, right?\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000 handed over\xfffethe \xf000ĉ\x0001\x0001!\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: I'm truly grateful, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000A trainer as kind as you is sure to\xfffemake any Pokémon around happy.\xf000븁\x0000This is a token of my thanks.\xfffeTreasure it!\xf000븁\x0000
Aloe: That there's a Moon Stone!\xf000븁\x0000There are Pokémon out there that'll\xfffeevolve if you use that on them.\xf000븁\x0000Well, I've got to get the Dragon Skull\xfffeback to the museum.\xf000븁\x0000Alright, watch yourself out there!\xf000븁\x0000
I keep running day after day\xfffeto chase a dream...\xf000븀\x0000To be Isshu's Marathon Champion!
This is a path through the forest, but...\xf000븁\x0000The cut-down trees here are delivered\xfffefrom Hodomoe City to the rest of the world.
Have you heard of phytoncides?\xf000븁\x0000I don't really get what they are, but\xfffeapparently, feeling good in the forest\xf000븀\x0000can be owed to phytoncides!
Mmm... I feel it...\xfffeThe presence of tough Pokémon...
Touching surfaces covered with\xfffemoss feels somehow pleasing.
Trainer Tips!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe\xfffeThey're hard to find in the forest,\xfffebut there many lost items here!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeTry searching all over!
