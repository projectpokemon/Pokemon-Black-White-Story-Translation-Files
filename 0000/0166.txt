I heard about these Pokémon statues\xfffeand came to investigate!\xf000븁\x0000
By the way, these statues are\xfffeactually Pokémon called Hihidaruma.\xf000븁\x0000They're currently asleep\xfffeand all hardened up.\xf000븁\x0000
As for how long they've existed,\xfffewell, a rough estimate...\xf000븁\x0000Like, wow! Over 2500 years ago!\xfffeThat seems to be\xf000븀\x0000when they fell asleep, at least.\xf000븁\x0000It's around the same era in which\xfffethis ruin, the Ancient Castle,\xf000븀\x0000was prosperous.\xf000븁\x0000Could it possibly be they\xfffeguarded the town?\xf000븁\x0000
These Pokémon...\xf000븁\x0000They're in a state of contemplative sleep,\xfffeso if they wake up,\xf000븀\x0000they'll be active once more.\xf000븁\x0000And to wake up the Hihidaruma...\xfffeyou need this!\xf000븁\x0000A RageCandyBar!!\xf000븁\x0000That said, \xf000Ā\x0001\x0000,\xfffeI'll give one to you!\xf000븁\x0000
Well, I'll be heading back\xfffeto the Pokémon lab.\xf000븀\x0000Buh-byyye!!\xf000븁\x0000
