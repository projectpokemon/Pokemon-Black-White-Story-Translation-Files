Whew...\xfffeWhat kind of day might today be?\xf000븁\x0000Challengers always come\xfffeone after the next...\xf000븁\x0000And accomplish naught.\xfffeI am Gima of the Elite Four.\xf000븁\x0000And may you fulfill your\xfffepurpose as my opponent!\xf000븁\x0000
I put in all my strength,\xfffeand this is how chance rolled.\xf000븀\x0000A loss is a loss...\xf000븁\x0000And so your victory glitters bright.\xf000븁\x0000Yes, you are radiant now indeed.
Yes, I am an unsightly loser...\xfffeand nothing more.\xf000븁\x0000Now...\xfffethat strength of yours...\xf000븁\x0000You would do well to test it\xfffeagainst the others of the Elite Four.
...Impressive.\xf000븁\x0000So you have been victorious over\xfffeall members of the Elite Four.\xf000븁\x0000But this is not yet the end!\xf000븁\x0000There is one more opponent whom\xfffeyou must try your hand against.\xf000븁\x0000The most powerful in the\xfffePokémon League, the Champion Adeku...\xf000븁\x0000Or perhaps...\xfffeThis man, N...\xf000븁\x0000Which you will fight, I do not know,\xfffebut inspect the central plaza's statue\xf000븀\x0000and proceed to the final room.
Life is a battle that must be fought\xfffewith the cards we are given.\xf000븁\x0000Rather than raising complaint\xfffeat being given useless cards,\xf000븀\x0000it's key to discover how to use them.\xf000븁\x0000Now, let us begin...\xf000븁\x0000The winner will take everything,\xfffeand the loser will be left with nothing.\xf000븁\x0000Such battles are\xfffea proof of existence...\xf000븁\x0000
Well, in our world,\xfffea bad way of winning...\xf000븀\x0000is a good way of losing.\xf000븁\x0000Such a simple dichotomy,\xfffeyet amusingly melancholy.\xf000븁\x0000A flipped coin has no reason\xfffeto land on either heads or tails.\xf000븁\x0000Sometimes, it may just not fall at all.
What a display...!\xf000븁\x0000One of the nice things about Pokémon\xfffebattles is that even the ones you lose\xf000븀\x0000can teach you lessons, hm?\xf000븁\x0000Now...\xfffethat strength of yours...\xf000븁\x0000You would do well to show it\xfffeto the others of the Elite Four!
