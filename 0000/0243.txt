Wharf #2\xfffeBut in terms of sightseeing,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeit's definitely Wharf #1!
Liberty Lighthouse\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeOnly authorized personnel\xfffeare allowed entry!
The police force came, er,\xffferunning here on defense ships!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThanks to their efforts,\xfffewe caught a load of bad guys!
Is the Pokémon alright?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe island's been so\xfffequiet after that incident...
Team Plasma never dies!

I won't let evil stand!
Hurry up and move it!
